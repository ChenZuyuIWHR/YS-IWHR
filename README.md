We upload 4 charts of eigenvalues, 1 chart of original data and the book of "Cyclic records of TBM drilling data: the Yingsong Water Diversion Project" (in Chinese).

The original chart contains 199 items of data which were recorded by secsors in TBM. The eigenvalues charts contain different types of eigenvalues which were calaulated by 199 items of original data for one boring cycle. The eigenvalues charts contains:
- d02 means the distance of boring cycle is shorter than 0.2m
- d05 means the distance of boring cycle is shorter than 0.5m but longer than 0.2m
- d10 means the distance of boring cycle is shorter than 1.0m but longer than 0.5m 
- d20 means the distance of boring cycle is shorter than 1.8m but longer than 1.0m

And the main eigenvalues we use are Tpi-slope (Column 58) and Tpi-R2:1-sse/sst (Column59) while the main original data we use are Pr (Column 143），RPM (Column 122），T (Column 126).
